API: Application Programming Interface is the bridge between client and server of the application
In client server model, client request the server and server responds to the client using API's .
The most used API's in web developement are REST API/Restful API's.They send and receive the data in JSON (Javascript Object Notation) Format.
eg: [
    {
        "key":"value"
    }
]

To call or get data from API, we can used
fetch : fetch is the default method provided by browser to request the data from server.
   fetch(url/endpoint,options)

Axios : Axios is the third party library which can be used instead of fetch
npm install axios
import axios from 'axios'
axios.method(url,options)

The fetch or axios are asynchronous functions so that they return promises
These promises can be resolved by using then--catch or async/await
syntax: fetch(url,options)
        .then((res)=>res.json())
        .then((data)=>console.log(data))
        .catch((err)=>console.log(err))

syntax:  async function functionName(){
         const res = await fetch(url,options)
         const data = await res.json()
         console.log(data)  // for error handling, we can use try-catch
}

How to handle API's in React?
To Handle API's or the side effects, we use a hook called "useEffect"
useEffect is used whenever the dynamic data is fetching from server or any asynchronous functions need to be handled
useEffect(()=>{
    //code
},[dependency Array])
useEffect Works in all stages of component lifecycle(Mounting+updating+unmounting)

different cases of dependency array:
   i. if there is no dependency array , then useEffect will work at mounting stage and updating of any state
   ii. if the dependency array is empty , then useEffect will work only at mounting stage
   iii. if the dependency array contains some values, the useEffect will work at mounting and updating the state of only those value

Major use cases are: fetching the data, timers(setTimeout/setInterval) , updating the DOM
