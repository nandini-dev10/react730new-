Hook: Hooks are pre defined functions in react from version 16. These hooks 
      i. holds the state (useState)
      ii.  run side effects (useEffect)
      iii. access life cycle behaviour
      iv. integrate with concurrent rendering
hooks must be presented at top level because react them by call order
main/popular hooks we use:
i. useState: its purpose is to make state of a value and maintains it. state is mutable
    const [value,setValue]= usestate(initialValue)
value contains intially initialValue and setValue is a function that is used to change/replace the value
state is asynchronous so the next synchronous lines will run first
 eg:
 const [value,setValue]=useState(0)
 setValue(5)
 console.log(value)

ii. useEffect: it is used to run side effects /async functions such as api calls, timers or cleanup logic
useEffect(callbackfunction,dependencyArray)
empty dependencyArray -- run once
dependencyArray with values -- run at starting and everytime the state of those values changes
no dependencyArray -- run at starting and everytime , any value state changes

iii. useMemo : it is used to memorize or cache expensive calculations
useMemo(callbackfunction,dependencyArray)
This should be used for strict calculations

iv.useCallback: it is used to cache functions.it maintans the stable identity  of functions.
it is useful when passing callbacks to memorized childern
it is also useful to safeguard from re render for childern dependencies
useCallback(callbackfunction,dependencyArray)

v.useRef : it is used to do DOM manipulation. it assumes reference for every element of DOM.
Mainly used to store valuees,counters,flags,timers etc..,


React Compiler(started from React 19)handles both useMemo and useCallback by default , so there is no need of them if react compiler is there.
