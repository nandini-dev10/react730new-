Routing in React: React cannot do/provide Routing by default.To do the Routing, we use a library called React Router DOM. it is the standard library for enabling navigation between pages without reloading the browser in React Web Applications

steps:
  step 1: npm install react-router-dom
  step 2: we need to wrap the complete code/app into BrowserRouter. it enables Routing to entire APP
  import {BrowserRouter} from 'react-router-dom'
  function App(){
    return (
        <BrowserRouter>
           //code
        </BrowserRouter>
    )
  }
  step 3:we can define Routes and Each Route with path and Element
    <Routes>
       <Route path="/about" element={<AboutComponent />} />
       <Route path="/contact" element={<ContactComponent />} />
    </Routes>
if my website loads at localhost:5173 and if i goto localhost:5173/about it shows AboutComponent

  step 4: if i want to go to specific path by clicking a link without reploading the page, then i have to use <Link to="path"></Link> instead of anchor tag
  <Link to="/about">Goto About page</Link>

  step 5: If you need a page which depicts not found page, then Route path should be *
  <Route path="*" element={<NotFoundComponent />}

Programatic navigation : In case, we want to make a page navigate to another programatically(after clicking a button/after specific time etc..,), then we can use hook called "useNavigate"
import {useNavigate} from 'react-router-dom'
function Login(){
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  function handleNavigate(){
    navigate('/dashboard')
  }
    return (
      <button onClick={handleClick}>click me</button>
    )
}

URL Parameters: To get URL Parameters, you can use useParams hook
for eg: https://amazon.com?pid=1234567
import {useParams} from 'react-router-dom'
function Dashboard(){
  const {pid} =useParams();
  return (
    <p>current product id:{pid}</p>
  )
}

Nested Routes : Incase one Route is inside another Route they are termed as Nested Routes. For them, we can use <Outlet /> to print child Routes
