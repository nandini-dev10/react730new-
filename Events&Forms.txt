Events and Forms in React:
    Events are the actions done by user to trigger a function call , a change in UI or any other action.Based on users actions, events are divided as multiple  such as 
    keyboard events
    mouse events
    form events etc..,

eg: imagine user clicks a button and a modal need to be opened
we invoke an event onClick to get the desired result

In JSX all events were camelcased and react handles events using something called synthetic events.
React does not use browser events directly so it wraps them in a synthetic event
This is html code
<button onclick="add()">click me</button>

This is React code
<button onClick={add}>click me </button>
<button onClick={()=>add(5,3)}>click me </button>

Events always pass an object by default called event object which handles events like controld,targets etc..,
eg:
  function getData(e){
    console.log(e.target.textContent)
  }
  <button onClick={getData}>click me </button>

  keyboard events : onKeyDown, onKeyUp
  Mouse Events : onMouseOver,onMouseDown,onMouseOut,onScroll,onClick,onDblClick
  Form Events : onChange,onInput,onSubmit,onSelect etc..,
  
Forms: forms in react are used to get the data from user using inputs and send the data to backend/server through API's
React Forms can be done in two ways
  i. Controlled Components: In these components, state management of inputs can be controlled easily . it uses events such as onInput,onChange,onSelect ,onSubmit etc..,

  In React, we have libraries to create forms like react hook forms or Formik. For validations we can use Zod


 ii. uncontrolled Components: In these components, state management of inputs cannot be controlled as they are handled by DOM. we can get values using DOM using a hook called useRef
